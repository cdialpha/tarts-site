Every community has numerous assets and skills, which are sufficient to start and sustain a long term development of the community. It is therefore important to bring the communities to identify and use those assets.

A minimum commitment of three to six months is required. This ensures that time invested in orientation, relationship‑building, and training is mutually beneficial. </p> <p>On‑site participants are expected to engage fully in daily farm life, including physical labor, communal responsibilities, and learning through practice. Life on the farm is simple and rooted in local rhythms; adaptability, humility, and respect for local leadership and customs are essential. </p> <p>If you are interested in either option, please share a clear statement of intent outlining your skills, preferred mode of involvement, availability, and motivations. We prioritize applicants whose expectations align closely with the realities of our work and setting.</p> </div> </div> </section>  <section class=" bg-g1 p-8 pb-16" aria-label="Volunteering opportunities"> <h1 class="font-bold text-xl">Contact Us</h1> </section> ` })}`;
